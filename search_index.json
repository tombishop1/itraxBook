The multi-sensory data can include radiography, optical images, magnetic susceptibility, but most importantly energy-dispersive x-ray florescence (ED-XRF) measurements of elemental abundance. The data can be harder to work with compared to some other palaeoenvironmental techniques because: Very large quantities of data are produced. ED-XRF measurements can be made every 100-200 μm, so for long core sections, these datasets are large. Simple line-graphs can become problematic, and multivariate analysis can become unworkable on some software. Images can be very large and need correct alignment. Combining them with line-graphs or other images can be troublesome. ED-XRF elemental data is compositional, but dimensionless (they do not have units attached e.g. [ppm]). This can make the use of traditional statistical tools and tests problematic. This guide comes from a series of seminars offered to users of the Itrax core scanner at The University of Manchester Geography Laboratories in 2020. 0.2 The itraxR Package The itraxR package offers a range of convenience functions for working with Itrax data. The book mostly uses the functions in this package, but the source code is available and fully commented, so is easy to as a basis for other work. The package and code are available from github.com/tombishop1/itraxR. 0.3 Prerequisites This guide assumes a basic knowledge of R and the tidyverse, including data types, assignments, and pipes. It also assumes a background knowledge of the core scanner and the nature of the data it produces; see Croudace et al. (2019) and references therein. Some of the sections on data analysis assume some knowledge of compositional data analysis. 0.4 Example Data All of these examples given in this book are from Piston core CD166/19, which was recovered from the Agadir Basin during the RRS Charles Darwin expedition CD166 in 2004 (Wynn and Cronin (2005)). The core site is located at 31°31’ N, 17°11.77’ W at a water depth of 4502 m. The coring operation recovered 4.3 m of sediment composed of hemipelagite and turbidites. The hemipelagic sediments range from cream-brown carbonate-rich marl/ooze to red-brown clays. The turbidites include siliciclastic, volcaniclastic and calcareous sediments. The split core sections were analysed using the Cox Analytical Systems Itrax core scanner at the British Ocean Sediment Core Research Facility, National Oceanography Centre (Southampton, UK). The split core surfaces were cleaned and loaded to the core scanner along with a radiographic reference sample (Francus, Kanamaru, and Fortin (2015)) and a colour card. The cores were first scanned to measure the sample surface height and to obtain optical images. The core sections were then covered with Mylar film to reduce sample desiccation during XRF scanning and x-radiography. XRF data were acquired using a molybdenum X-ray tube set at 30 kV and 30 mA with a dwell time of 30 seconds and a step size of 1 mm. X-radiographs were acquired with voltage and current set to 55 kV and 50 mA, respectively, and dwell time set to 500 ms. Step size for the x-radiography was set to 200 µm. Two replicate XRF scans were also performed for each of the three core sections that make up this core. The XRF settings for the replicates were kept consistent with those of the main XRF scan. The interval selected for the replicate scans ranged from 10 cm to 15 cm of the the total sample length. All raw XRF raw data were reprocessed using the QSpec spectral analysis software to optimise peak fitting. The data can be downloaded from the Github pages that form the source for this document, available at github.com/tombishop1/itraxBook.

They are described in the following sections. Note that your data may not contain all of these objects, depending on the exact scanner, configuration, or data repository you use. The folder structure may vary between operators, but typically there will be a folder for each scan section, and each will contain the data described in the following sections. Note that where radiographs and XRF data have been acquired using different step-sizes (measurement intervals), the operator will create seperate scan sections (folders) for the x-radiograph and XRF measurement. This is because a scan section can only have a single fixed step-size. For example, it is not uncommon for users to require an step-size of 200 μm for the x-radiograph, but only 1 mm for the XRF measurement. 1.1 Metadata Every scan folder has a document.txt file that contains information about the parameters of the scan. For example, it contains the current and voltage settings used for the x-ray tube, the step size, and the start and stop positions of the scan. It is a text file, although the formatting can be inconsistently rendered depending on the text editor used. Sometimes this information is required to process other parts of the data, and as such it is an important part of the overall data package. 1.2 XRF Data The XRF data can be split into two groups — “raw” and “processed” data. The raw data is contained in a separate folder called XRF data, and consists of a single file, beginning with L000000.spe and incrementing sequentially. This file can be read using a text editor and is tab-delimited. The first part is a header, containing metadata information. The second part is a table of all the channels of the detector and the corresponding count for each channel. Increasing channel numbers represent increasing energy, but some thought needs to be given to calibrating channels into an energy — this step is usually performed using specialist software. In addition, a file called sumspectra.spe is often included in the root directory; this is simply the sum of all the *.spe files in the XRF data directory, and is sometimes useful in processing the data. Processed data comes from the Q-Spec software (Cox Analytical Systems, Sweden) provided with the machine. Its function is to process the spectral data files (*.spe) into peak-areas for each element of interest by fitting a model to the data. The model needs some user input and intervention to optimise it, and the quality of the model can be assessed using a number of diagnostic parameters, the most important being the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE). The Q-Spec software can also perform some quantitative calibration of the data, although this is a less typical use-case. Often the operator will include a file that contains all of the settings used by Q-Spec to translate the raw data files into the peak area output file — this file will have the extension *.dfl and will often simply be called settings.dfl. The processed elemental data comes in the form of a text file comprising of a tab-delimited table, with a single row for each measurement step, and a column for parameters including individual element peak areas in counts (n) or intensities (n/mA). The data files commonly have names like result.txt or Results.txt, but may have been subsequently renamed. These are the ED-XRF data most commonly worked with by analysts. 1.3 Optical Images The scanner collects good quality optical images that have consistent lighting and because they are line-scan images, they do not suffer from optical distortions. Medium resolution images are usually included in all scan section folders (typically optical.tif), and optional high-resolution images are often included by operators elsewhere. High resolution images are typically supplied as both 8-bit and 16-bit images, and are usually hundreds of megabytes in size. Although the brightness of the lighting in the scanner is adjustable, images sometimes need to be brightened and/or have the contrast adjusted. This can be performed in desktop publishing software (e.g. Adobe Photoshop, Corel Photo-Draw), but it is easiest to use the open-source scientific image analysis software imageJ (NIH, USA). By including an appropriate colour reference card in the scan the image can be calibrated, although it is often desirable to increase the contrast and gamma to elucidate features of the core. The photograph is always of the entire length of the bed scanned, rather than cropped to the limits of an individual scan section. If multiple scan sections are placed on the bed and are scanned together, it will include all of the scanned sections. The image needs to be cropped using the metadata for the relevant scan section; this process is covered in later chapters. 1.4 Radiographic Images The scanner has an x-radiographic line array capable of producing good-quality x-radiographs of the cores. The scan data can be split into two parts — “raw” and “processed” data. The raw data (usually radiograph.raw) is a tab-delimited text file containing a matrix of greyscale values. Each column represents a single step (measurement interval, often set to between 50 and 200 μm), and each row represents a single pixel on the line array. The pixel spacing is around 20 μm. Note that the raw radiographic data contains pixels at the extremes that are outside of the coverage of the x-ray beam — these are obviously useless and need to be cropped. The processed image (radiograph.tif) has a lower resolution than the raw data. This is because the pixels must be square, and so the pixels are down-sampled to fit with the step-size of the scan. Thus, if the step-size was 200 μm, each pixel will be 200 x 200 μm, whereas the raw data will have rectangular pixels with dimensions of 20 x 200 μm. The data at the extremes of the radiograph are always cropped, so the radiograph has a coverage of around 13 mm of thw width of the core. Like the optical image, the radiograph often requires contrast and brightness adjustments, and these are easiest to perform in imageJ. With the inclusion of a suitable density standard, some relative or, where “u-channels” are used, absolute density calibration can be performed using these data; see Francus, Kanamaru, and Fortin (2015) for more. 1.5 Magnetic Susceptability Some scanners include a Bartington MS2E surface sensor, but the example dataset supplied here does not have magnetic susceptability data collected from an Itrax core scanner. References "],["importing.html", "Chapter 2 Importing Data 2.1 Metadata 2.2 XRF Data 2.3 Optical Images 2.4 Radiographic Images 2.5 Importing Everything", " Chapter 2 Importing Data All of the Itrax data is in either text-format or “tagged image format” (*.tif). Although this means it is easily read by the various import functions available in R, it still needs considerable cleaning and wrangling to get it to a point where it is usable for most analyses. There are three possible approaches to this task: Use existing functions published in the itraxR package available from github.com/tombishop1/itraxR. These are at an early stage and functionality might be broken, but are largely convenience functions for wrangling and analysing Itrax data. It is easy to install the package directly from Github using remotes::install_github(\"tombishop1/itraxR\"). Work in base R to wrangle the data. This is perfectly achievable, and much of the current itraxR functionality was originally written this way. Work in the tidyverse family of packages and style. For data wrangling tasks, this approach can result in simpler and more resilient code. In this guide examples will be given using the functions provided in itraxR, but the processes used in those functions will be explained, and the code used in those functions is fully commented so can be modified to suit particular needs. 2.1 Metadata The scan metadata file document.txt can be quickly parsed using itraxR::itrax_meta(). The output is a dataframe from which the individual components can be easily accessed through subsetting functions; for example as.numeric(itrax_meta()[6:7, 2]) would return a numeric vector of the start and end position of a scan. itrax_meta(&quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1/document.txt&quot;) ## Parameter Value Unit ## 1 Sample name CD166_19_S1 str ## 2 Section name CD166_19_S1 str ## 3 Aquisition date 22/9/2020 dd/mm/yyyy ## 4 Operator name MC str ## 5 Tube Mo element ## 6 Start coordinate 31.5 mm ## 7 Stop coordinate 1314.1 mm ## 8 Step size 1000 microns ## 9 Optical Start 0.5 mm ## 10 Optical End 1401.3 mm ## 11 Optical step size 0.188 mm ## 12 Rad. voltage 55 kV ## 13 Rad. current 50 mA ## 14 Rad. exposure 0 ms ## 15 line camera signal level 323154 at 25 ms ## 16 XRF ON ON/OFF ## 17 XRF voltage 30 kV ## 18 XRF current 30 mA ## 19 XRF exp. time 15 seconds ## 20 Start temperature \\xb0C ## 21 Stop temperature \\xb0C ## 22 Start humidity % ## 23 Stop humidity % ## 24 Start vacuum -95.0 kPa ## 25 Stop vacuum -94.8 kPa 2.2 XRF Data 2.2.1 Processed Data This is the data most commonly used in analysis and it can be quickly imported using itraxR::itrax_import(). Note that, like for the example data, it is possible to have more than one processed data file. Typically cores have at least two, one created at the time of the scan based on settings for a single point near the top of the sequence, and another from a holistic re-analysis of the sequence.

Often we will want to integrate them into a continuous dataset for analytical purposes. When joining cores that do not overlap, this process is trivial — the data might simply appended in order of depth, and a new column is added with the identity of the original core section. Where overlapping cores are present, there can be multiple measurements at a single depth (on different cores). In these cases not only will the individual measurements need to be re-ordered by depth, but an additional variable should be created that can be used in combination or alone to uniquely identify each measurement. The code below does this by creating an additional variable called label, with the name of the original core given in the named list. mylist &lt;- list(core1 = core1, core2 = core2) df &lt;- lapply(names(mylist), function(i) within(mylist[[i]], {label &lt;- i})) %&gt;% bind_rows() %&gt;% arrange(depth) This process can be simplified using itraxR::itrax_join(), for example: # import the core sections CD166_19_S1 &lt;- itrax_import(&quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1/Results.txt&quot;, depth_top = 0) CD166_19_S2 &lt;- itrax_import(&quot;CD166_19_S2/CD166_19_S2/Results.txt&quot;, depth_top = max(CD166_19_S1$depth)) CD166_19_S3 &lt;- itrax_import(&quot;CD166_19_S3/CD166_19_S3/Results.txt&quot;, depth_top = max(CD166_19_S2$depth)) #join them together CD166_19 &lt;- itrax_join(list(S1 = CD166_19_S1, S2 = CD166_19_S2, S3 = CD166_19_S3)) str(CD166_19) ## tibble [4,206 × 44] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ depth : num [1:4206] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... ## $ MSE : num [1:4206] 1.41 1.57 1.55 1.41 1.41 1.36 1.52 1.38 1.58 1.52 ... ## $ cps : num [1:4206] 34525 38370 39796 40022 41973 ... ## $ validity: logi [1:4206] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ... ## $ Al : num [1:4206] 76 57 74 26 53 27 72 78 69 70 ... ## $ Si : num [1:4206] 275 306 330 206 233 347 337 346 403 381 ... ## $ P : num [1:4206] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ S : num [1:4206] 10 0 32 21 37 28 59 19 44 30 ... ## $ Cl : num [1:4206] 1318 1513 1470 1312 1740 ... ## $ Ar : num [1:4206] 604 595 506 555 591 504 584 489 597 512 ... ## $ K : num [1:4206] 2565 2628 2378 2265 2947 ... ## $ Ca : num [1:4206] 112734 144287 162938 153194 135879 ... ## $ Sc : num [1:4206] 0 14 0 0 106 14 0 46 0 0 ... ## $ Ti : num [1:4206] 1661 1806 2121 2031 1826 ... ## $ V : num [1:4206] 51 88 22 75 89 107 0 71 23 91 ... ## $ Cr : num [1:4206] 258 326 301 306 440 401 440 407 449 336 ... ## $ Mn : num [1:4206] 508 559 483 485 738 792 799 868 794 647 ... ## $ Fe : num [1:4206] 35168 36494 35952 35512 44303 ... ## $ Ni : num [1:4206] 123 104 134 144 166 151 125 157 180 147 ... ## $ Cu : num [1:4206] 277 230 150 206 276 250 217 178 191 197 ... ## $ Zn : num [1:4206] 205 268 123 239 240 294 284 238 230 211 ... ## $ Ga : num [1:4206] 4 48 0 0 0 40 8 22 26 0 ... ## $ Ge : num [1:4206] 0 40 43 0 0 48 115 100 80 164 ... ## $ Br : num [1:4206] 491 605 550 609 659 709 583 582 635 545 ... ## $ Rb : num [1:4206] 329 76 295 313 304 318 337 323 223 306 ... ## $ Sr : num [1:4206] 8306 9181 9644 9940 10287 ... ## $ Y : num [1:4206] 15 140 119 107 180 106 52 77 112 144 ... ## $ Zr : num [1:4206] 255 322 280 475 160 312 319 319 552 484 ... ## $ Pd : num [1:4206] 31 78 75 66 31 72 31 54 58 70 ... ## $ Cd : num [1:4206] 13 34 55 24 34 28 56 62 96 79 ... ## $ I : num [1:4206] 38 48 80 67 23 58 30 53 93 43 ... ## $ Cs : num [1:4206] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ Ba : num [1:4206] 63 48 25 60 132 93 172 108 108 22 ... ## $ Nd : num [1:4206] 17 67 44 75 42 97 92 68 56 59 ... ## $ Sm : num [1:4206] 43 46 39 64 36 12 24 69 68 17 ... ## $ Yb : num [1:4206] 144 282 158 218 163 184 248 166 188 169 ... ## $ Ta : num [1:4206] 789 776 703 794 919 852 926 840 847 790 ... ## $ W : num [1:4206] 1992 2019 2016 2160 2344 ... ## $ Pb : num [1:4206] 77 0 13 152 54 54 75 111 78 0 ... ## $ Bi : num [1:4206] 72 136 199 134 157 182 151 185 116 164 ... ## $ Mo inc : num [1:4206] 26323 26778 26550 28310 31356 ... ## $ Mo coh : num [1:4206] 8799 9117 9303 9886 10140 ... ## $ position: num [1:4206] 32.5 33.5 34.5 35.5 36.5 ... ## $ label : chr [1:4206] &quot;S1&quot; &quot;S1&quot; &quot;S1&quot; &quot;S1&quot; ... 2.2.3 Raw Data Sometimes it is useful to work with raw data rather than the calculated intensity data from the Q-Spec software. In this case, the raw data can be read directly from the individual files in the relevant directory. For individual measurements this is fairly trivial, although it must be considered that the data output is not calibrated to an energy and the data are in counts, not intensities. If the entire scan is read, some mechanism to iterate through the individual data files, adding them to a structured data object with relevant metadata (positions, for example) is required. 2.3 Optical Images In order to make the images usable for plotting alongside other data, they need to be cropped to the scanned area and referenced to the position or a depth variable. The initial crop can be supressed using trim = FALSE if the whole image is desired. Images in R are read in as a matrix with 3 dimensions (length, width, and the three colours). The data can be imported using itraxR::itrax_image(). This function can produce a basic diagram (shown in subsequent section), but here we focus on the structure of the imported object. $image is a three dimensional array, the first two dimensions are the length of the core and the width, respectively. Those two dimensions have \"dimnames\" (rownames() and colnames() respectively). For the rownames(), this is an interpolated position, in mm, and for the colnames() this is the width in mm, and always begins at 0. The last dimension always has a length of three, and comprises of the red, green and blue values for each of the pixels. $meta is a table containing selected data from the scan metadata relevant to the image. str(itrax_image(file = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1/optical.tif&quot;, meta = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1/document.txt&quot;, trim = FALSE)) ## List of 2 ## $ image: num [1:7452, 1:524, 1:3] 0.0706 0.0706 0.0706 0.0784 0.0784 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 3 ## .. ..$ : chr [1:7452] &quot;0.5&quot; &quot;0.688001610522078&quot; &quot;0.876003221044155&quot; &quot;1.06400483156623&quot; ... ## .. ..$ : chr [1:524] &quot;0&quot; &quot;0.187976382179281&quot; &quot;0.375952764358561&quot; &quot;0.563929146537842&quot; ... ## .. ..$ : NULL ## $ meta :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 6 obs. of 3 variables: ## ..$ Parameter: chr [1:6] &quot;Start coordinate&quot; &quot;Stop coordinate&quot; &quot;Step size&quot; &quot;Optical Start&quot; ... ## ..$ Value : chr [1:6] &quot;31.5&quot; &quot;1314.1&quot; &quot;1000&quot; &quot;0.5&quot; ... ## ..$ Unit : chr [1:6] &quot;mm&quot; &quot;mm&quot; &quot;microns&quot; &quot;mm&quot; ... 2.4 Radiographic Images The function itraxR::itrax_radio() imports the processed radiographic images (*.tif) in a very similar way to that for the optical images, the main difference being the matrix only has two dimensions (length and width) as the image is greyscale. str(itrax_radiograph(file = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1_RAD/radiograph0.tif&quot;, meta = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1_RAD/document.txt&quot;)) ## List of 2 ## $ image: num [1:6570, 1:67] 1 1 0.755 0.686 0.755 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. ..$ : chr [1:6570] &quot;0&quot; &quot;0.200045669051606&quot; &quot;0.400091338103212&quot; &quot;0.600137007154818&quot; ... ## .. ..$ : chr [1:67] &quot;0&quot; &quot;0.200015220700152&quot; &quot;0.400030441400304&quot; &quot;0.600045662100457&quot; ... ## $ meta :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 10 obs. of 3 variables: ## ..$ Parameter: chr [1:10] &quot;Start coordinate&quot; &quot;Stop coordinate&quot; &quot;Step size&quot; &quot;Optical Start&quot; ... ## ..$ Value : chr [1:10] &quot;0.0&quot; &quot;1314.1&quot; &quot;200&quot; &quot;0.5&quot; ... ## ..$ Unit : chr [1:10] &quot;mm&quot; &quot;mm&quot; &quot;microns&quot; &quot;mm&quot; ... However, if there is a desire to manipulate the raw data from the radiographic image, some further work is required because the “pixel” is not square, but rectangular; that is to say the length of the pixel differs from its width. On the core scanner a single pixel has a width across the core of 20 μm, but has a variable coverage along the core (usually between 50 and 200 μm). The processed image downscales the pixel width to match the pixel length in order to force square pixels, losing some resolution along the way. In addition, it should be noted that unlike the optical images that always begin from position == 0, the radiographic images have defined start and end points just like an XRF scan, the parameters of which can be accessed from the $meta object, or using itraxR::itrax_meta(). rm(list = ls()) 2.5 Importing Everything Given the structured nature of individual core section scans, it might be helpful to import everything into a single data object (list()). This is particularly helpful when dealing with large numbers of core sections. However, some care should be taken here, as it is easy to end up holding large quantities of data in memory, particularly where images are included. The structure of this can be adapted to your needs, but could look something like the following example. These are the data that will be used elsewhere in this guide.

However, you may still encounter poor quality data that needs removing from subsequent analysis. This can be broadly defined as: Data at the start and end of the the core, where a volume of core material is “missing”. Measurements where the optical configuration is out of position (marked as validity == 0), often due to holes or stones in the core. Areas of the core with low total counts. Individual measurements that are statistical outliers. The easiest way to do this is using a tidyverse style sequence of pipes that set the observations of faulty data as NA. 3.1 Low Count Rates 3.2 Surface Slope Corrections There is a relationship between the slope of the surface of the core material and the intensity for most elements. Hence areas with a large slope may produce an increase or decrease in a particular element intensity regardless of any actual change in the abundance of an element. This can be corrected for where the effect can be quantified experimentally, but Jarvis (2015) report results of experiments where the slope varies from -0.3 to +0.3 causing variation of around 120 to 80% of the true value. As such, we might initially seek to exclude areas of the core with a high slope. By default, itraxR::itrax_import() doesn’t import the sample surface variable, so the parameter parameters = \"all\" should be passed to access it. The computation is simple to perform using dplyr::lag(), and could be used as part of a conditional expression that would mark all measurements with a slope beyond a certain tolerance as having validity == FALSE. For example, the example below marks all values with a slope (in either direction) greater than 0.1 mm/200 μm (1:5) as being invalid. As shown for the core below, the core slope is well within the defined tolerances. CD166_19_S1$xrf %&gt;% mutate(slope = `sample surface` - dplyr::lag(`sample surface`)) %&gt;% mutate(new_validity = ifelse(slope &lt;=-0.1 | slope &gt;=0.1 | is.na(slope) == TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)) %&gt;% select(c(`sample surface`, slope, validity, new_validity)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(slope)) + geom_histogram(bins = 20) + xlim(-0.15, 0.15) + geom_vline(xintercept = c(-0.1, 0.1)) 3.3 Tube current Although element peak areas are not exactly linearly related to tube current, they can be approximated to a linear relationship (see Jarvis (2015)). The Q-Spec software can report either peak areas (n) or intensities (n/mA), and it is easy to tell which you are using: peak areas are always integers, but intensities are always fractions. It is easy to adjust from one to the other: current &lt;- as.numeric(CD166_19_S1$metadata[18, 2]) head(CD166_19_S1$xrf %&gt;% mutate(intensity_Fe = round(Fe/current, 3)) %&gt;% # convert to intensity mutate(peakarea_Fe = round(intensity_Fe*current)) %&gt;% # convert to peak area select(Fe, intensity_Fe, peakarea_Fe)) ## [90m# A tibble: 6 x 3[39m ## Fe intensity_Fe peakarea_Fe ## [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m [3m[90m&lt;dbl&gt;[39m[23m ## [90m1[39m [4m3[24m[4m5[24m168 [4m1[24m172.

We will also be using tidypaleo, a package made available from Dewey Dunnington on Github. 4.1 Plotting XRF Data For simple biplots, ggplot2 provides the following solution. This includes different colour coding to differentiate the core sections. ggplot(data = na.omit(CD166_19_xrf), mapping = aes(x = depth, y = `Mo coh`/`Mo inc`)) + geom_line(aes(color = label)) + coord_flip() + scale_x_reverse() + labs(x = &quot;Depth [mm]&quot;,color = &quot;Core&quot;) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) Where a traditional stratigraphic plot is desired, the tidypaleo package provides useful functionality for producting these. However, the data does need to converted to long-form from the existing table. In this way tidypaleo::facet_geochem_gridh works in a way similar to ggplot::facet_wrap but has been creates a stratigraphic plot. We can use the package periodicTable to quickly get a list of symbols used in the periodic table. data(periodicTable) elements &lt;- periodicTable$symb rm(periodicTable) CD166_19_xrf %&gt;% mutate(`coh/inc` = `Mo coh`/`Mo inc`) %&gt;% select(Fe, Ti, `coh/inc`, Mn, depth, label) %&gt;% tidyr::pivot_longer(!c(&quot;depth&quot;, &quot;label&quot;), names_to = &quot;elements&quot;, values_to = &quot;peakarea&quot;) %&gt;% tidyr::drop_na() %&gt;% mutate(elements = factor(elements, levels = c(&quot;Fe&quot;, &quot;Mn&quot;, &quot;Ti&quot;, &quot;coh/inc&quot;))) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = peakarea, y = depth)) + tidypaleo::geom_lineh(aes(color = label)) + scale_y_reverse() + facet_geochem_gridh(vars(elements)) + labs(x = &quot;peak area&quot;, y = &quot;Depth [mm]&quot;) + tidypaleo::theme_paleo() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) 4.2 Plotting Images The package itraxR provides functions for importing and creating basic plots of both the photographic and radiographic images. For the optical images, it is almost always necessary to trim the image to the extent of the actual scan, or extraneous image is included (e.g. the calibration card in the example shown below). The function itraxR::itrax_image() allows the extent of the scan to be defined, or extracted from the metadata. In the example below, trim = FALSE forces the whole image to be shown. myImage &lt;- itrax_image(file = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1/optical.tif&quot;, meta = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1/document.txt&quot;, trim = FALSE, plot = TRUE ) For radiographic images the function itraxR::itrax_radiograph() can be used using an identical syntax as itraxR::itrax_image(). Often the contrast needs to be adjusted, so a contrast-adjusted radiograph is supplied in the example data (radiograph0.tif). myRadio &lt;- itrax_radiograph(file = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1_RAD/radiograph0.tif&quot;, meta = &quot;CD166_19_S1/CD166_19_S1_RAD/document.txt&quot;, plot = TRUE ) The simple plots generated as a side effect of these functions are sometimes sufficient for simple plots, but for more complex diagrams you will need to generate them from scratch. For example, it is often desirable to overplot the radiograph on the optical image. The code below does this. Note the calculations made for the xmin = and ymin = parameters for annotation_custom() when adding the radiograph rasterGrob(); these correctly position the radiograph along the centre of the image. ggplot() + ylim(rev(range(as.numeric(row.names(myImage$image))))) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(range(as.numeric(colnames(myImage$image))), 0), limits = range(as.numeric(colnames(myImage$image)))) + labs(y = &quot;Position [mm]&quot;, x = &quot;[mm]&quot;) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(myImage$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(as.numeric(row.names(myImage$image)))/-1, ymin = min(as.numeric(row.names(myImage$image)))/-1, xmin = min(as.numeric(colnames(myImage$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(myImage$image))) ) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(myRadio$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(as.numeric(row.names(myRadio$image)))/-1, ymin = min(as.numeric(row.names(myRadio$image)))/-1, xmin = mean(as.numeric(colnames(myImage$image))) - mean(as.numeric(colnames(myRadio$image))), xmax = mean(as.numeric(colnames(myImage$image))) + mean(as.numeric(colnames(myRadio$image))) ) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) It is often desirable to combine a sequence of cores. This is trivial for cores like CD166_19 where there are no overlapping sections. However, note that the coring depth information is different from the position that these images are referenced to. The coring depth is not contained in any of the Itrax metadata, and should be recorded elsewhere, whereas position refers to the coordinates on the Itrax core holder. In the code below the depth information is extracted from the combined XRF data created in a previous chapter (for example using max(CD166_19[which(CD166_19$label == \"S2\"),]$depth) to get the maximum depth of the middle section. The radiographs can be added in the same fashion as the previous example. ggplot() + ylim(rev(range(CD166_19_xrf$depth))) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(range(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S1$image$image))), 0), limits = range(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S1$image$image)))) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) + labs(y = &quot;Depth [mm]&quot;, x = &quot;[mm]&quot;) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(CD166_19_S1$image$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(CD166_19_S1$xrf$depth)/-1, ymin = min(CD166_19_S1$xrf$depth)/-1, xmin = min(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S1$image$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S1$image$image))) ) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(CD166_19_S2$image$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(CD166_19_S2$xrf$depth)/-1, ymin = min(CD166_19_S2$xrf$depth)/-1, xmin = min(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S2$image$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S2$image$image))) ) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(CD166_19_S3$image$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(CD166_19_S3$xrf$depth)/-1, ymin = min(CD166_19_S3$xrf$depth)/-1, xmin = min(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S3$image$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S3$image$image))) ) Where there are overlaps it is often desirable to plot the cores adjacent to one another. It is simply a case of adjusting the xmin = and xmax = parameters in the annotation_custom() function for every other section. In this context the x-axis labels become largely meaningless and can be omitted. ggplot() + ylim(rev(range(CD166_19_xrf$depth))) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(c(0, max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S2$image$image)))*2)), limits = c(0, max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S2$image$image)))*2)) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1) + labs(y = &quot;Depth [mm]&quot;, x = &quot;[mm]&quot;) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(CD166_19_S1$image$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(CD166_19_S1$xrf$depth)/-1, ymin = min(CD166_19_S1$xrf$depth)/-1, xmin = min(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S1$image$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S1$image$image))) ) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(CD166_19_S2$image$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(CD166_19_S2$xrf$depth)/-1, ymin = min(CD166_19_S2$xrf$depth)/-1, xmin = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S2$image$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S2$image$image)))*2 ) + annotation_custom(rasterGrob(CD166_19_S3$image$image, width = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;), height = unit(1, &quot;npc&quot;)), ymax = max(CD166_19_S3$xrf$depth)/-1, ymin = min(CD166_19_S3$xrf$depth)/-1, xmin = min(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S3$image$image))), xmax = max(as.numeric(colnames(CD166_19_S3$image$image))) ) Note that omitting the line coord_fixed(ratio = 1) allows the aspect ratio of the plot to be reshaped. Although usually it is desirable to keep the plot in the correct shape, sometimes for very long sequences the images end up so narrow as to be quite useless, so the x-axis can be stretched to accentuate the features in it. The example below simply omits the coord_fixed() line from the previous example. Finally, it may be necessary to plot the images horizontally rather than the more traditional vertical plots often used in down-core data presentation. aperm() and t() may be used for the optical and radiographic images respectively to transpose the x- and y-coordinates, but the images will need to be mirrored so that the tops of the sections are on the right-hand side and the graphs run from oldest to youngest when read left-to-right, in the generally accepted order of these types of graph. "],["transforming-data.html", "Chapter 5 Transforming Data 5.1 Ratios and Normalisation 5.2 Preparing Data for Multivariate Data Analysis 5.3 Data Reduction", " Chapter 5 Transforming Data The XRF data typically reported from the Itrax core scanner come from the spectral processing software Q-Spec. The output is usually in the form of an intensity, which is a dimensionless metric derived from the size of the spectral peak for a particular element, above the background Bremsstralung radiation, sometimes normalised for the tube current and/or counting time. 5.1 Ratios and Normalisation These data are compositional, and represent the changes in the relative proportions of all components of the matrix, measured and un-measured. As such it is likely the data will need transforming for certain types of multivariate analysis. As previously mentioned, these data are dimensionless, and as such do not represent a quantity, but are directly related to the absolute amount of a particular element in the matrix. It is often the case that ratios of elements are used to represent changes in composition — this is sometimes referred to as normalisation, or normalising one element against another. It is trivial to calculate element ratios, to the extent that these can often simply be calculated where they are required rather than saving them to memory. For example, if a plot of the Compton divided by the Rayleigh scatter was desired, there is no need to save the computed value to a new variable (e.g. coh_inc &lt;- df$Mo.coh/df$Mo.inc) — simply define the calculation during plotting. 5.2 Preparing Data for Multivariate Data Analysis Where multivariate methods (cluster analysis, principle components analysis, correlation matrices) are required, it is usually necessary to transform data. This is because the statistical assumptions that underlie these methods are often not met when dealing with compositional data like that from an XRF core-scanner. There is no “right” or ideal way to deal with these issues, but a common method is to use a form of log transformation. Here we use a centred log transformation, which cannot be performed on zero values. df %&gt;% chemometrics::clr(df) There are a number of possible solutions to this problem of zero values, none ideal, but the most common are to add an arbitrary number to the entirety of the data, or to replace zero values with a very small number, perhaps the limit of precision or the limit of detection. In the example shown, the limit of precision for the peak area intensity is used (0.001). input[input == 0] &lt;- 0.001 A final solution may be to exclude zero values from any subsequent analysis, although not all methods tolerate NA in the data. Where there are many zero values for a particular variable, the variable may not provide good data and could be excluded. df %&gt;% na_if(0) In most multivariate analyses there are a number of variables which have high signal-to-noise ratios or otherwise only add noise to multivariate methods. In these cases, they might be excluded from multivariate methods. The selection of variables for inclusion is a matter for the analyst. It goes without saying that variables that are not part of the composition (that is, anything that is not an element) must be removed from the data used for multivariate analysis. df %&gt;% select(-any_of(c(&quot;Mg&quot;, &quot;Co&quot;, &quot;Mo&quot;)) Finally, in order to correctly identify the measurements to their original data source, it is necessary to use row names that uniquely identify observations. For single scans this is not usually an issue — the depth or position variable can be used. However, where a dataset is a composition of multiple cores, you may find that there are multiple observations for a particular depth where cores overlap. In the example shown we create a unique name for each observation by concatenating the name of the core as recorded in the label column of a core sequence joined using itraxR::itrax_join() with the corresponding depth variable, but the code could be modified to suit a different work flow. rowlabels &lt;- str_c(df$label, df$depth, sep = &quot;_&quot;) input &lt;- df %&gt;% select(any_of(elements)) input &lt;- input %&gt;% select(-any_of(c(&quot;Mg&quot;, &quot;Co&quot;, &quot;Mo&quot;))) input[input == 0] &lt;- 0.001 library(chemometrics) input &lt;- clr(input) row.names(input) &lt;- rowlabels 5.3 Data Reduction Sometimes it is necessary to reduce the resolution of Itrax XRF data, usually to facilitate direct comparison with some other lower resolution data. For example, if calibrating using ICP-MS sub-samples taken at 10 mm intervals, but the Itrax XRF scan is at 0.2 mm, it will be necessary to average 50 Itrax measurements for each ICP-MS measurement. This is facilitated using the itrax_averaging() function. Despite the name, the function can use any appropriate summary function (e.g. standard deviation sd() or median median().) # get the Ti mean and standard deviation in 10 mm intervals head(data.frame(depthmin = itrax_averaging(CD166_19_xrf, 10)$depthmin, depthmax = itrax_averaging(CD166_19_xrf, 10)$depthmax, Ti_mean = itrax_averaging(CD166_19_xrf, 10)$Ti, Ti_sd = itrax_averaging(CD166_19_xrf, 10, fun = sd)$Ti)) ## depthmin depthmax Ti_mean Ti_sd ## 1 1 10 2101.3 331.36789 ## 2 11 20 2460.8 306.68833 ## 3 21 30 2222.5 50.31733 ## 4 31 40 2264.9 118.89253 ## 5 41 50 2311.8 163.99377 ## 6 51 60 2401.3 90.61770 "],["multivariate-methods.html", "Chapter 6 Multivariate Methods 6.1 Correlation Coefficients 6.2 Unconstrained Cluster Analysis 6.3 Constrained Cluster Analaysis 6.4 Principle Components Analysis", " Chapter 6 Multivariate Methods Input data often needs extensive preparation if useful results are to be obtained — transformation, dealing with zero values, and NA values.
