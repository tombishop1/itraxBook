During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 it became necessary to formalise (or at least, organise) the support offered to students using the Itrax core scanner at The University of Manchester Geography Laboratories so they could be offered online. This led to an unexpectedly popular series of seminars. When these came to an end, we decided it would be useful to summarise our seminars into a reference guide that could be updated over time. This is that guide. 0.2 Prerequisites This guide assumes a basic knowledge of R and the tidyverse, including data types, assignments, and pipes. It also assumes a background knowledge of the core scanner and the nature of the data it produces. Some of the sections on data analysis assume some knowledge of compositional data analysis. "],

They are described in the following sections. Note that your data may not contain all of these objects, depending on the exact scanner, configuration, or data repository you use. 1.1 Metadata 1.2 XRF Data 1.3 Optical Images 1.4 Radiographic Images 1.5 Magnetic Susceptability "],

Although this means it is easily read by the various import functions available in R, it still needs considerable cleaning and wrangling to get it to a point where it is useable. A number of convienience functions are provided in the package itraxR. 2.1 Metadata The scan data file document.txt can be read using itraxR::itrax_meta(). This is considerably easier than attempting to read it in a text editor, although this is possible. example(itrax_meta) ## ## itrx_m&gt; itrax_meta(system.file(&quot;extdata&quot;, &quot;document.txt&quot;, package = &quot;itraxR&quot;)) ## Parameter Value Unit ## 1 Sample name WV17-2-D1 str ## 2 Section name WV17-2-D1 str ## 3 Aquisition date 24/1/2017 dd/mm/yyyy ## 4 Operator name THB str ## 5 Tube Mo element ## 6 Start coordinate 27.3 mm ## 7 Stop coordinate 1064.3 mm ## 8 Step size 2000 microns ## 9 Optical Start 0.1 mm ## 10 Optical End 1102.9 mm ## 11 Optical step size 0.047 mm ## 12 Rad. voltage 60 kV ## 13 Rad. current 40 mA ## 14 Rad. exposure 450 ms ## 15 line camera signal level 571116 at 25 ms ## 16 XRF ON ON/OFF ## 17 XRF voltage 30 kV ## 18 XRF current 55 mA ## 19 XRF exp. time 10 seconds ## 20 Start temperature 26 \\xb0C ## 21 Stop temperature 27 \\xb0C ## 22 Start humidity 22 % ## 23 Stop humidity 21 % ## 24 Start vacuum -96.0 kPa ## 25 Stop vacuum -96.2 kPa 2.2 XRF Data 2.2.1 Processed Data This process is integrated, along with some other functionality, in itraxR::itrax_import(). 2.2.2 Joining XRF Data 2.2.3 Raw Data Sometimes it is useful to work with raw data rather than the calculated intensity data from the Q-Spec software. In this case, the raw data can be read directly from the individual files in the relevant directory. For individual measurements this is fairly trivial, although it must be considered that the data output is not calibrated to an energy and the data are in counts, not intensities. If the entire scan is read, some mechanism to iterate through the individual data files, adding them to a structured data object with relevant metadata (positions, for example) is required. 2.3 Optical Images In order to make the images useable for plotting beside other data, they need to be cropped to the scanned area and referenced to the position or a depth variable. Images in R are read in as a matrix with 3 dimensions (length, width, and the three colours). To begin with the start and end positions of the scan need to be established; this usually involves parsing the metadata file (e.g. itraxR::itrax_meta()[]), although in some circumstances they can be obtained from another data source (e.g. range(myData[,&quot;Position&quot;])). These then need to be mapped onto individual pixel values using the known size of a single pixel. Once this has been calculated, it is trvial to then subset the part of the image required. 2.4 Radiographic Images The workflow for manipulating the processed radiographic images (*.tiff) is very similar to that for the optical images, the main difference being the matrix only has two dimensions (length and width) as the image is greyscale. However, if there is a desire to manipulate the raw data from the radiographic image, some further work is required because the “pixel” is not square, but rectangular. That is to say the length of the pixel differs from its width. On the core scanner a single pixel has a width across the core of 20 micrometers, but has a variable coverage along the core (usually between 50 and 200 micrometers). The processed image downscales the pixel width to match the pixel length in order to force square pixels, losing some resolution along the way. 2.5 Magnetic Susceptability Magnetic susceptability files are easily parsed using standard tools.

["tidying-data.html", "Chapter 3 Tidying Data", " Chapter 3 Tidying Data In the functionality provided by itraxR, the need for data cleaning is much reduced. However, you may still encounter poor quality data that needs removing from subsequent analysis. This can be broadly defined as: Data at the start and end of the the core, where a volume of core material is “missing”. Measurements where the optical configuration is out of position (marked as validity == 0), often due to holes or stones in the core. Areas of the core with low total counts. Individual measurements that are statistical outliers. The easiest way to do this is using a tidyverse style sequence of pipes that set the observations of faulty data as NA. "],
