# Tidying Data

In the functionality provided by `itraxR`, the need for data cleaning is much reduced. However, you may still encounter poor quality data that needs removing from subsequent analysis. This can be broadly defined as:

- Data at the start and end of the the core, where a volume of core material is "missing".
- Measurements where the optical configuration is out of position (marked as `validity == 0`), often due to holes or stones in the core.
- Areas of the core with low total counts.
- Individual measurements that are statistical outliers.

The easiest way to do this is using a `tidyverse` style sequence of pipes that set the observations of faulty data as `NA`.
