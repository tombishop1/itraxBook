# Exporting Data

Data is easy to export from `R`. Tables can be exported by piping to `readr::write_csv()`. For diagrams created in `ggplot2`, pipe to `ggsave()`. Sometimes it is necessary to reduce the resolution of Itrax XRF data, usually to facilitate direct comparison with some other lower resolution data. For example, if calibrating using ICP-MS sub-samples taken at 10 mm intervals, but the Itrax XRF scan is at 0.2 mm, it will be necessary to average 50 Itrax measurements for each ICP-MS measurement. This is facilitated using the `itrax_reduce()` function. The example below demonstrates calculating the averages for contiguous 20 mm chunks of the XRF data. 

```{r data_reduction, warning=FALSE}
# get the data as 20 mm intervals
itrax_reduce(CD166_19_xrf %>% drop_na(), by = 20) %>%
  select(-label) %>%
  head() %>%
  kable()
```
